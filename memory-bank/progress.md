# Progress - K8s Cluster Setup

## Current Status
The Kubernetes cluster setup script is actively running in Terminal 2. The automated setup process has been successfully initiated after resolving the VirtualBox PATH issue.

## What's Working
‚úÖ **VirtualBox**: Detected and accessible at `C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\` (version 7.1.12)  
‚úÖ **Vagrant**: Installed and working at `C:\Program Files\Vagrant\bin\vagrant.exe`  
‚úÖ **Prerequisites Check**: Both tools verified and script proceeding  
üîÑ **Cluster Setup**: [`setup-k8s-cluster-fixed.bat`](../setup-k8s-cluster-fixed.bat:1) currently executing

## Issues Resolved
1. **VirtualBox PATH Issue**: Original script failed because `vboxmanage` wasn't in system PATH
2. **Solution Applied**: Created [`setup-k8s-cluster-fixed.bat`](../setup-k8s-cluster-fixed.bat:10) that explicitly sets VirtualBox path
3. **Terminal Compatibility**: Used `cmd /c` to execute batch file from bash terminal

## Current Execution Phase
The setup script is running through these automated steps:
- ‚úÖ Prerequisites validation (Vagrant + VirtualBox)
- üîÑ VM provisioning (master: 192.168.56.10, worker1: 192.168.56.11, worker2: 192.168.56.12)
- ‚è≥ Kubernetes installation on all three nodes
- ‚è≥ Master node initialization with Calico CNI
- ‚è≥ Worker nodes joining to cluster
- ‚è≥ Cluster verification and status check

## Expected Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 10-15 minutes
- **VM Startup**: 2-3 minutes
- **K8s Installation**: 5-7 minutes
- **Cluster Init**: 3-5 minutes
- **Verification**: 1-2 minutes

## Next Steps
- Monitor script execution for completion or errors
- Verify cluster status once setup completes
- Provide cluster access instructions
- Document final cluster state
