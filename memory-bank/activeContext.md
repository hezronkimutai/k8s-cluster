# Active Context - K8s Cluster Setup

## Current Situation
The user is trying to set up a Kubernetes cluster using the provided Windows batch script ([`setup-k8s-cluster.bat`](../setup-k8s-cluster.bat:1)). The script failed during prerequisite checks because VirtualBox is not installed.

## Error Details
```
[ERROR] VirtualBox is not installed or not in PATH.
[INFO] Please install VirtualBox from: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
```

## Next Steps
1. **Install VirtualBox**: User needs to download and install VirtualBox for Windows
2. **Verify Installation**: Ensure [`vboxmanage`](../setup-k8s-cluster.bat:24) command is available in PATH
3. **Check Vagrant**: Verify Vagrant is also installed (script checks both)
4. **Re-run Setup**: Execute the batch script again after prerequisites are met

## Prerequisites Required
- **VirtualBox**: Hypervisor for running the cluster VMs
- **Vagrant**: VM orchestration tool
- **System Resources**: At least 8-12 GB RAM for the cluster (Master: 2GB + Worker: 1GB + Host overhead)

## Windows-Specific Considerations
- Hyper-V should be disabled when using VirtualBox
- Administrative privileges may be required for installation
- System restart might be needed after VirtualBox installation

## Current Focus
Helping user install VirtualBox and get the automated Kubernetes cluster setup running successfully.
