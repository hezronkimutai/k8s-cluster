# Active Context - K8s Cluster Setup

## Current Situation - RESOLVED âœ…
The user encountered a VirtualBox PATH detection issue when running the Kubernetes cluster setup script. VirtualBox was installed but not accessible via system PATH, causing the setup script to fail during prerequisite checks.

## Problem Details
```
[ERROR] VirtualBox is not installed or not in PATH.
[INFO] Please install VirtualBox from: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
```

**Root Cause:** VirtualBox was installed at `C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe` but not added to system PATH.

## Resolution Implemented âœ…
1. **Created improved Windows script** ([`setup-k8s-cluster-fixed.bat`](../setup-k8s-cluster-fixed.bat:1)):
   - Checks system PATH first
   - Falls back to default VirtualBox installation path
   - Tests VirtualBox functionality before proceeding
   - Provides clear error messages and guidance

2. **Enhanced Linux/macOS script** ([`setup-k8s-cluster.sh`](../setup-k8s-cluster.sh:1)):
   - Added detection for multiple common VirtualBox locations
   - Improved error handling and user guidance
   - Cross-platform compatibility

3. **Updated documentation** ([`README.md`](../README.md:1)):
   - Added VirtualBox PATH configuration section
   - Included troubleshooting guide
   - Referenced improved automation scripts
   - Provided manual PATH fix instructions

## Technical Solution Details
- **Windows Detection**: Checks PATH, then `C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe`
- **Linux Detection**: Checks PATH, `/usr/bin/vboxmanage`, `/usr/local/bin/vboxmanage`
- **macOS Detection**: Checks PATH, then `/Applications/VirtualBox.app/Contents/MacOS/VBoxManage`
- **Validation**: All scripts now test VirtualBox functionality before proceeding

## Current Status
- âœ… VirtualBox detection issue resolved
- âœ… Improved scripts created and tested
- âœ… Documentation updated with troubleshooting guide
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility ensured
- ðŸ”„ Setup script currently running successfully

## Next Actions
User can now reliably run the Kubernetes cluster setup using the improved scripts, regardless of VirtualBox PATH configuration.
